# Age-Of-Cheap-Empires

3rd Year Python Project realised with 5 other students in a semester

The goal was to remake the famous RTS game Age of Empire, 
using our low knoowledge of the programming language Python and our basic understanding of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

We've learnt a lot through the six month, such as planning work sessions, using the GIT tool, working as a team, using advanced programming technics compared to what
we knew before starting

There is also an online version of this game
